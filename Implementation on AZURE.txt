After the resource has been created, go to resources, and click on the one you just created,

now we need to create a device template before creating a device, go to device templates and click on it, then click on create device template, then click on "iot device" and click on next customize
you can give the template any name then click on next/review and then click on create
then you would need to select the custom model, then we need to add capability, these would direct our data to the right place, the capabilities are just like the columns in our dataframe, eg, temperature, humidity, etc,

so click on add capability, and in the display name of the first one, the name is temperature, the capability type would be telemetry for all the capabilities then for Sementic type select temperature, do same for humidity and all other sensor data you would like to add.

give the device any name  and ID and then select the template you just created and published and then click on create
 click on the device created and from the overview and raw data and you will see the template used and the capabilities added 
 then click on connect and you will take note of 3 things
 	1. ID scope
	2. Device ID
and 	3. Primary key

copy and paste these 3 things in the appropriate sections of the code and run the code,

when you run the code, it creates a hotspot, Esp8266 HOTSPOT after connecting to it, you can manage your wifi settings and after successfully connecting to the internet, it would create the server and start logging the data on the iot central on Azure and you can view it in the raw data section of the device you created.
